The task is to build a dynamic and interactive quiz application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application should allow users to answer a series of multiple-choice questions, receive instant feedback on their selections, and track their score throughout the quiz. Questions must be loaded dynamically from a predefined data structure, and each question should display multiple options with only one correct answer. Upon selecting an answer, the app should indicate whether it is correct or incorrect, visually highlight the result, and update the userâ€™s score accordingly. At the end of the quiz, the user should see their total score and have the option to restart the quiz. The interface should be polished, responsive, and user-friendly, delivering a smooth and engaging quiz experience.
